# README For MathScape #

This Python script generates a slope field when given a differential equation. 

-Used Python and advanced mathematical algorithms to create MathScape, a slope field generator 

-Implemented interactive slope field generation using vector calculus, enabling students to visualize and explore the behavior of differential equations through dynamic graphical representations. Main purpose is to be used as a verification tool when trying to graph the particular solution of a differential equation when given an initial condition. 

* `code.py` - This file contains the code for the slope field generator.
